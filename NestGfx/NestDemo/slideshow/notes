Notes on the four gentlemen:
The plum, orchid, bamboo and chrysanthemum are name the Four Noble Ones (or
Four Gentlemen), representing four plants which are subjects in traditional ink
and wash painting. Each plant is often matched to a season and a set of
virtues.

Plum tree (winter): metaphor for inner beauty and humble displays under adverse
conditions.

Orchid (spring): symbolizes humility and nobility.

Bamboo (summer): represents tolerance, open-mindedness, self cultivation and
integrity.

Chrysanthemum (fall): the virtue to withstand all adversities.


If possible, these four should be shown in succession in the above order.
