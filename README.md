## Nest Generation 1 UI Toolkit
This is the release of the toolkit used to create a patch for Google's Nest Thermostat to disable remote control and log file uploading. It has not been tested in over 4 years and probably won't work on newer generation thermostats.

It requires FreeType for font rendering and a working ARM toolchain for compilation. Until someone tests this code on a modern Nest, it will be for reference only.
